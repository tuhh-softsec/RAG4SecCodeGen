Generate secure Python code for the following: from flask import Flask, request, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/showName')
def name():
    '''
    Get "name" from the request, validate it,
    make a response with it, and return the response object
    '''Here are some additional security guidelines to follow if the coding scenario satisfies the specific preconditions:
#1
Preconditions: The code unit allows users to make some kind of requests
Guidelines: The code unit should prevent users making further requests if their limit has been exceeded
#2
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles HTTP request and responses
Guidelines: The code unit should not read data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response
#3
Preconditions: The code unit handles user requests
Guidelines: The code unit should ensure the requesting user is authorized to access a protected object
#4
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles web requests
Guidelines: The code unit should not accept untrusted data as input from a web request
#5
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles HTTP requests
Guidelines: The code unit should use stringent allowlist that limit the character set based on the expected value of the request parameter while dynamically constructing webpages
#6
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles HTTP requests
Guidelines: The code unit should set the session cookie to HttpOnly
#7
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles HTTP requests
Guidelines: The code unit should specify encoding in the HTTP header
#8
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles HTTP requests
Guidelines: The code unit should validate the data in the request including hidden fields; cookies; headers; the URL itself; and so forth. 
#9
Preconditions: The code unit constructs messages using HTTP parameters for web pages
Guidelines: Escape special characters before writing the HTTP parameter back to the page.
#10
Preconditions: The code unit is a python web app or web page.
 Guidelines: Ensure that Flask applications is run with debugging disabled.
