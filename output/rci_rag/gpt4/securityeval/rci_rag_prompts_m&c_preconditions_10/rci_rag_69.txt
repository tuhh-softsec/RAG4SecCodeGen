Generate secure Python code for the following: def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    '''
    Compare the actual password with the typed password by checking whether every character matches.
    '''Here are some additional security guidelines to follow if the coding scenario satisfies the specific preconditions:
#1
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles temporary passwords
Guidelines: The code unit should keep temporary passwords in the memory for the specific time interval; beyond which the passwords becomes invalid
#2
Preconditions: The code unit stores passwords
Guidelines: The code unit should not store passwords with compression
#3
Preconditions: 1. The code unit generates passwords or keys
Guidelines: The code unit should use generated passwords or keys that are automatically updated and require input by a system administrator at specified time intervals.
#4
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentications
Guidelines: For inbound authentication details;hash passwords using standard library functions like hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac.
#5
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentications
Guidelines: For outbound authentication details; encrypt the credentials or the enclosing data
stores or configuration files; and using permissions to restrict access.
#6
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentications
Guidelines: For outbound authentication details; 
use permissions to restrict access to credentials or the enclosing data stores or configuration files
#7
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentication or login credentials
Guidelines: The code unit should prevent unauthorized access to stored credentials
#8
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentication or login credentials
Guidelines: The code unit should write credentials only after encryption 
#9
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentication or login credentials
Guidelines: The code unit should prevent unauthorized access to transmitted credentials
#10
Preconditions: The code unit is a python web app or web page.
 Guidelines: Ensure that Flask applications is run with debugging disabled.
