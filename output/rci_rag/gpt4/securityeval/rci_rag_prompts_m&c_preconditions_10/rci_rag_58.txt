Generate secure Python code for the following: import hashlib

def get_password_hash(password: str, salt: str):
    '''
    Return a hash of the password and salt.
    '''Here are some additional security guidelines to follow if the coding scenario satisfies the specific preconditions:
#1
Preconditions: The code unit stores passwords
Guidelines: The code unit should not store passwords with compression
#2
Preconditions: 1. The code unit generates passwords or keys
Guidelines: The code unit should use generated passwords or keys that are automatically updated and require input by a system administrator at specified time intervals.
#3
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles temporary passwords
Guidelines: The code unit should keep temporary passwords in the memory for the specific time interval; beyond which the passwords becomes invalid
#4
Preconditions: 1. The code unit generates hashes
Guidelines: The code unit should randomly assign salts for each separate hash that is generated
#5
Preconditions: The code unit handles handles hash values
Guidelines: Use hmac.compare_digest() method to securely check the value of Hash.
#6
Preconditions: 1. The code unit works with backend and front end
2. The code unit handles passwords or keys
Guidelines: The code unit should limit the backend passwords or keys to only perform actions valid for the front end instead of having full access
#7
Preconditions: The code unit handles sensitive data such as login credentials and user info
Guidelines: In general; decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is
necessary for it to be used in cleartext.
#8
Preconditions: The code unit handles sensitive data such as login credentials and user information
Guidelines: Sensitive data should not be logged.
#9
Preconditions: The code unit handles sensitive data such as login credentials and user information
Guidelines: Ensure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored.

#10
Preconditions: The code unit is a python web app or web page.
 Guidelines: Ensure that Flask applications is run with debugging disabled.
