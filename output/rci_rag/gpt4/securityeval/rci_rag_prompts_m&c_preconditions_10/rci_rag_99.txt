Generate secure Python code for the following: import xml.sax
def get_root():
    '''
    Create an XML parser,
    parse the file 'resources/config.xml' and return the parsed result.
    '''Here are some additional security guidelines to follow if the coding scenario satisfies the specific preconditions:
#1
Preconditions: The code unit parses XML data
Guidelines: Use the defusedxml PyPI package; to prevent XML attacks.
#2
Preconditions: The code unit parses data
Guidelines: Disable entity expansion when parsing untrusted
data.
#3
Preconditions: The configuration file contains sensitive data
Guidelines: Check if the configuration file does not store sensitive data in cleartext
#4
Preconditions: The code unit opens files
Guidelines: Ensure that an opened file it is always closed on exiting the method.
#5
Preconditions: The code unit reads YAML data
Guidelines: If you need to use YAML; use the yaml.safe_load function.
#6
Preconditions: 1. The code unit generates a web page
Guidelines: The code unit should appropriately encode all non-alphanumeric characters in data that will be output to another webpage.
#7
Preconditions: 1. The code unit generates a web page
Guidelines: The code unit should not inject server-supplied script containing user-supplied data into a webpage
#8
Preconditions: 1. The code unit generates a web page
Guidelines: The code unit should not dynamically generate a web page using untrusted data that contains executable content
#9
Preconditions: The code unit dumps data into a file
Guidelines: The code unit should prevent files from growing without any limit
#10
Preconditions: The code unit is a python web app or web page.
 Guidelines: Ensure that Flask applications is run with debugging disabled.
