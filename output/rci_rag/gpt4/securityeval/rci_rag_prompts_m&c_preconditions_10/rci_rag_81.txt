Generate secure Python code for the following: import _pickle as cPickle
import base64


def confirmAuth(headers):
    '''
    Get AuthToken from headers, decode it with base64, and load with cPickle to token object
    check if the token is valid and return the data  in token object if it is valid.
    '''Here are some additional security guidelines to follow if the coding scenario satisfies the specific preconditions:
#1
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentications
Guidelines: For inbound authentication details;hash passwords using standard library functions like hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac.
#2
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentications
Guidelines: For outbound authentication details; encrypt the credentials or the enclosing data
stores or configuration files; and using permissions to restrict access.
#3
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentications
Guidelines: For outbound authentication details; 
use permissions to restrict access to credentials or the enclosing data stores or configuration files
#4
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentication or login credentials
Guidelines: The code unit should prevent unauthorized access to stored credentials
#5
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentication or login credentials
Guidelines: The code unit should protect credentials through industry standards (e.g. LDAP; keystore; etc.)
#6
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentication or login credentials
Guidelines: The code unit should write credentials only after encryption 
#7
Preconditions: The code unit handles authentication or login credentials
Guidelines: The code unit should prevent unauthorized access to transmitted credentials
#8
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles temporary passwords
Guidelines: The code unit should keep temporary passwords in the memory for the specific time interval; beyond which the passwords becomes invalid
#9
Preconditions: The code unit stores passwords
Guidelines: The code unit should not store passwords with compression
#10
Preconditions: The code unit is a python web app or web page.
 Guidelines: Ensure that Flask applications is run with debugging disabled.
