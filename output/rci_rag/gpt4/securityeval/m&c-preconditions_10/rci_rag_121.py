# Note: Ensure that the transmission of data is over HTTPS and that the client-side is secure.
# Implement MFA and secure password reset flows as part of the overall authentication process.
# Ensure proper access control for the DynamoDB table and manage AWS IAM policies correctly.
# Implement secure session management, rate limiting, account lockout, and secure credential transmission.
# Protect against client-side attacks such as XSS or CSRF by implementing proper input validation and output encoding.

# Additional security measures:
# - Enforce HTTPS on the server side, for example by setting up a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS or by using a security middleware that enforces HTTPS.
# - Integrate MFA using a library or service that provides robust MFA support.
# - Configure AWS IAM policies following the principle of least privilege.
# - Use secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookies for session management.
# - Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks.
# - Ensure credentials are transmitted securely and not exposed in URLs, logs, or referer headers.
