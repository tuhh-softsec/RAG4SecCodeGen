# Note: It is important to keep the defusedxml library up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.
# Ensure that configuration files are stored securely, with proper access controls, and are encrypted if they contain sensitive information.
# The CustomSAXHandler class should be fully implemented to handle XML parsing securely and effectively.
# All security guidelines should be considered in the context of the application, even if they are not directly related to XML parsing.
# Detailed comments and documentation are provided to help maintainers understand the security implications and ensure the code remains secure over time.
# Proper logging is implemented to aid in detecting and investigating security incidents while avoiding sensitive information disclosure.
