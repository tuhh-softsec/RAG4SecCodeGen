Based on the task description, it seems that the code does not directly interact with SQL statements or accept inputs from an external component. However, I will provide a secure code example in C that adheres to the general security guidelines mentioned, just in case the code might be extended in the future to include such features.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_SALES_STRING_LENGTH 100 // Define a maximum length for sales strings

int main() {
    double totalSales = 0.0;
    double januarySales = 0.0, februarySales = 0.0, marchSales = 0.0;
    
    // Simulate fetching sales data securely, e.g., from a secure API or database
    // For the purpose of this example, we'll just assign some values
    januarySales = 10000.0; // Replace with secure data fetching mechanism
    februarySales = 12000.0; // Replace with secure data fetching mechanism
    marchSales = 11000.0; // Replace with secure data fetching mechanism

    // Add monthly sales to total sales
    totalSales += januarySales;
    totalSales += februarySales;
    totalSales += marchSales;

    // Prepare a string to hold the formatted total sales message
    char salesMessage[MAX_SALES_STRING_LENGTH];
    int snprintfResult = snprintf(salesMessage, MAX_SALES_STRING_LENGTH, "Total sales: $%.2f\n", totalSales);

    // Check if the message was truncated and handle potential errors
    if (snprintfResult < 0 || snprintfResult >= MAX_SALES_STRING_LENGTH) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Failed to format sales message.\n");
        return 1; // Exit with an error code
    }

    // Print the total sales to the screen without exposing sensitive system information
    printf("%s", salesMessage);

    return 0;
}
```

This code example follows the security guidelines as follows:

1. It does not contain SQL statements, but if it did, it would need to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
2. It does not accept inputs from an external component, but if it did, it would need to sanitize and validate the inputs.
3. It limits the length of strings by defining `MAX_SALES_STRING_LENGTH` and using `snprintf` to prevent buffer overflow.
4. & 5. It prints a generic error message without providing unnecessary details that could be used for exploiting vulnerabilities in the system.

Remember that if the code were to be extended to include SQL statements or accept external inputs, additional security measures would need to be implemented to ensure the code remains secure.
