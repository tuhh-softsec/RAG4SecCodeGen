Below is a secure code snippet in C that adheres to the security guidelines provided. This code is designed to create a new file or open an existing file for writing, with the specified flags. It also includes checks and measures to ensure that the security guidelines are followed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>

#define MAX_FILE_SIZE 10485760 // Maximum file size of 10 MB

// Function to generate a unique filename to prevent overwriting and execution of arbitrary files
void generate_unique_filename(char *filename, size_t size) {
    // Generate a unique file name using a timestamp or a UUID (for simplicity, using PID here)
    snprintf(filename, size, "logfile_%d.log", getpid());
}

// Function to create or open a file with the specified flags
int secure_open_file(const char *base_filename) {
    char unique_filename[256];
    generate_unique_filename(unique_filename, sizeof(unique_filename));

    // Open the file with the specified flags and mode 0600 to ensure it is not world-readable or executable
    int fd = open(unique_filename, O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_WRONLY | O_EXCL, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Implement a check to prevent the file from growing indefinitely
    struct stat st;
    if (fstat(fd, &st) != -1) {
        if (st.st_size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
            fprintf(stderr, "File size exceeds the maximum allowed limit.\n");
            close(fd);
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    } else {
        perror("Error getting file size");
        close(fd);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    return fd;
}

// Main function to demonstrate the secure file open operation
int main() {
    // Open the file securely
    int fd = secure_open_file("logfile");

    // Write to the file (example log message)
    const char *log_message = "This is a log message.\n";
    if (write(fd, log_message, strlen(log_message)) == -1) {
        perror("Error writing to file");
        close(fd);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Close the file
    close(fd);

    printf("File created and written to successfully.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet includes the following security measures:

1. It generates a unique filename for each log file to prevent overwriting and execution of arbitrary files (Guideline #5).
2. It opens the file with mode `0600` to ensure that the file is not world-readable or executable (Guideline #2 and #4).
3. It checks the file size before writing to prevent the file from growing indefinitely (Guideline #3).
4. It does not include any sensitive information in the log message (Guideline #1).

Please note that this code is a basic example and does not include all possible security measures. Depending on the specific requirements and environment, additional security practices may be necessary.
