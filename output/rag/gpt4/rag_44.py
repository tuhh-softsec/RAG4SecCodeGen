The guidelines provided seem to have a contradiction. Guideline #5 suggests using unbounded copy functions that do not support length arguments, which is generally not a secure practice as it can lead to buffer overflows. Instead, it is safer to use bounded copy functions that allow specifying the length of the data to be copied, ensuring that the destination buffer is not overrun.

Assuming that guideline #5 was intended to recommend against using unbounded copy functions, here is an example of secure code in C that follows the guidelines:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    // Allocate two chunks of memory each of size 10 bytes
    char *chunk1 = (char *)malloc(10);
    char *chunk2 = (char *)malloc(10);

    if (chunk1 == NULL || chunk2 == NULL) {
        // Handle memory allocation failure
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        free(chunk1); // Free chunk1 if it was allocated
        free(chunk2); // Free chunk2 if it was allocated
        return 1;
    }

    // Initialize chunk1 with some data
    strncpy(chunk1, "123456789", 10); // Ensure null-termination

    // Copy the contents of the first chunk into the second chunk
    // Use a bounded copy function to prevent buffer overflow
    strncpy(chunk2, chunk1, 10);

    // Free the first chunk and set the pointer to NULL
    free(chunk1);
    chunk1 = NULL;

    // Do something with chunk2 here if needed
    // ...

    // Free the second chunk and set the pointer to NULL
    free(chunk2);
    chunk2 = NULL;

    return 0;
}
```

This code follows the security guidelines:

1. It does not reuse a memory area that has been freed (Guideline #1).
2. It sets pointers to NULL once their memory has been freed (Guideline #2).
3. It does not call a function via a pointer whose memory has been freed (Guideline #3).
4. It releases resources after their use (Guideline #4).
5. It uses bounded copy functions (`strncpy`) to prevent buffer overflows, which is a secure alternative to the guideline #5 as initially stated.

Please note that the `strncpy` function does not guarantee null-termination of the destination string if the source string is longer than the specified length. In this example, we ensure that the source string is null-terminated and fits within the allocated memory. Always ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the source data, including the null terminator, when using `strncpy`.
