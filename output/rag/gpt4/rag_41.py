The task at hand involves generating random floats and converting them to strings. Since we are not directly dealing with external data, hashes, output encoding, OS command construction, or buffer operations in the traditional sense, some of the security guidelines may not apply directly. However, we can still apply the principle of limiting the length of strings to prevent potential buffer overflows.

Here is a secure code snippet in C that adheres to the guidelines:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

#define MAX_STRING_LENGTH 64

int main() {
    // Seed the random number generator
    srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));

    // Generate three random floats
    float randomFloat1 = (float)rand() / (float)(RAND_MAX);
    float randomFloat2 = (float)rand() / (float)(RAND_MAX);
    float randomFloat3 = (float)rand() / (float)(RAND_MAX);

    // Prepare strings to store the float values
    char string[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];
    char string2[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];
    char string3[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];

    // Convert the floats to strings with a maximum of 6 decimal places
    // and ensure that the string is null-terminated to prevent buffer overflow
    snprintf(string, MAX_STRING_LENGTH, "%.6f", randomFloat1);
    snprintf(string2, MAX_STRING_LENGTH, "%.6f", randomFloat2);
    snprintf(string3, MAX_STRING_LENGTH, "%.6f", randomFloat3);

    // Output the strings (properly encoded as they are simple floats)
    printf("String 1: %s\n", string);
    printf("String 2: %s\n", string2);
    printf("String 3: %s\n", string3);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of security measures taken:

1. `MAX_STRING_LENGTH` is defined to limit the length of the strings, preventing buffer overflows.
2. `snprintf` is used instead of `sprintf` to ensure that the string will not exceed the maximum length, including the null terminator.
3. The random number generator is seeded with the current time to ensure different sequences of random numbers for each execution.
4. The code does not handle external data, construct OS commands, or perform buffer operations that involve external inputs, so guidelines #1, #5, and #4 are not directly applicable.
5. Since we are not generating hashes, guideline #2 is not applicable.
6. The output is properly encoded as the `printf` function is used to output simple float values, which do not require additional encoding or escaping, thus adhering to guideline #3.

By following these practices, the code remains secure and robust against common vulnerabilities related to string handling in C.
