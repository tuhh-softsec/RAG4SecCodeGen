Below is a secure C++ code snippet that adheres to the provided security guidelines:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

// Function to get value from array with additional bounds checking
int getValueFromArray(const std::vector<int>& array, size_t size, unsigned int index) {
    // Check for out-of-bounds index
    if (index >= size) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Index out of bounds." << std::endl;
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    return array[index];
}

int main() {
    // Example array of integers
    std::vector<int> id_sequence = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Read integer from standard input
    unsigned int index;
    std::cin >> index;

    // Check for input errors
    if (std::cin.fail() || index < 0) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Invalid input." << std::endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Call getValueFromArray and return the value as exit code
    int value = getValueFromArray(id_sequence, id_sequence.size(), index);
    return value;
}
```

Explanation of how the code adheres to the security guidelines:

#1: The function `getValueFromArray` checks if the provided index is within the bounds of the array size before accessing the array element. If the index is out of bounds, the program prints an error message and exits with `EXIT_FAILURE`.

#2: The index parameter in `getValueFromArray` is declared as an `unsigned int` to ensure that it cannot be negative.

#3: The code uses the `std::vector` container from the C++ Standard Library, which is a vetted framework that provides safe access to its elements.

#4: The code does not take input arguments via the command line. It only reads input from the standard input (`std::cin`), which is in line with the guideline.

#5: The code checks for input errors by verifying if the input operation to `std::cin` failed and if the index is within the valid range. Since `index` is an `unsigned int`, it cannot be negative, so we only check for input failure.

Please note that the `id_sequence` array is hardcoded in this example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely populate this array from a file or other input source, ensuring that the input is sanitized and validated before use.
