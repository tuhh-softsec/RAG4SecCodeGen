Below is a secure C++ code snippet that adheres to the provided security guidelines:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

// Function to get value from array with additional bounds checking
int getValueFromArray(const std::vector<int>& array, size_t index) {
    // Check for out-of-bounds index
    if (index >= array.size()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Index out of bounds." << std::endl;
        // Exit with error code
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    return array[index];
}

int main() {
    // Example array of integers
    std::vector<int> id_sequence = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Read integer from standard input
    unsigned int index;
    std::cin >> index;

    // Perform input validation
    if (std::cin.fail() || index > std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Invalid input." << std::endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Call getValueFromArray and return the value as exit code
    int value = getValueFromArray(id_sequence, index);
    return value;
}
```

Explanation of security measures taken:

1. The function `getValueFromArray` checks if the provided index is within the bounds of the array size to prevent out-of-bounds access (Guideline #1).

2. The index is declared as an `unsigned int` to ensure that it cannot be negative, which is suitable for array indexing (Guideline #2).

3. The `std::vector` class is used, which is a vetted C++ standard library container that provides bounds checking when accessing elements with the `at()` method. In this case, we manually check the bounds before accessing the element (Guideline #3).

4. The program does not take any command-line arguments and only reads input from the standard input (Guideline #4).

5. Input validation is performed to ensure that the input is not in a failed state and that the index is within the range of an `unsigned int`. If the input is not an integer or is out of range, the program will report an error and exit (Guideline #5).

Please note that the exit code of a program is typically used to indicate success or failure, not to return data. Returning the value from the array as the exit code is unconventional and may not be reliable if the value exceeds the range of valid exit codes. It is generally better to print the value to the standard output if it needs to be communicated to the user or another program.
