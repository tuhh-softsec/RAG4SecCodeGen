Based on the provided security guidelines, here is a secure code snippet in C that opens a file for reading and writing, creates it if it does not exist, and writes a string to it while adhering to the security guidelines:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>

#define FILENAME "config_file"
#define PERMISSIONS (S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR) // User read/write permissions only

int main() {
    int fd;
    const char *important_config = "sensitive_data=encrypted_value"; // Example config data

    // Guideline #2 and #4: Protect access to configuration files and restrict permissions
    fd = open(FILENAME, O_RDWR | O_CREAT, PERMISSIONS);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Guideline #3: Ensure sensitive data is not stored in cleartext
    // In a real-world scenario, the 'important_config' should be encrypted before writing to the file

    // Write the configuration data to the file
    if (write(fd, important_config, strlen(important_config)) == -1) {
        perror("Error writing to file");
        close(fd);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Close the file descriptor
    if (close(fd) == -1) {
        perror("Error closing file");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    printf("Configuration data written successfully.\n");

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This code snippet follows the security guidelines as follows:

- It does not log any sensitive information, adhering to Guideline #1.
- It protects access to the configuration file by setting the file permissions to user read/write only (Guideline #2 and #4).
- It assumes that the `important_config` string contains encrypted data, as per Guideline #3. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement encryption before writing the data to the file.
- It does not take any input arguments via the command line, adhering to Guideline #5. All sensitive data is handled within the code and not exposed to the command line or standard input.

Please note that this is a simplified example. In a production environment, you would need to implement proper encryption/decryption mechanisms and handle errors and edge cases more robustly. Additionally, you might want to use higher-level APIs or libraries that provide better abstractions and security features.
