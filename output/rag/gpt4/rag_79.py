Below is an example of a secure PHP code snippet that follows the provided security guidelines for the task of uploading a PDF file, storing its filepath in a MySQL database, and using the filepath to download the PDF file later.

```php
<?php
// Assuming a function 'connectToDatabase' that returns a PDO instance connected to your MySQL database
$db = connectToDatabase();

// Function to generate a unique and secure filename
function generateUniqueFilename($originalName) {
    $extension = pathinfo($originalName, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
    $safeName = bin2hex(random_bytes(16)); // Generate a random name
    return $safeName . '.' . $extension;
}

// Function to handle the upload of the PDF file
function upload_pdf($file) {
    // Define the path to store uploaded files outside of the web document root
    $uploadDir = '/var/www/uploads/';

    // Ensure the file is a PDF
    $finfo = new finfo(FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE);
    if ($finfo->file($file['tmp_name']) !== 'application/pdf') {
        die("Only PDF files are allowed.");
    }

    // Disallow path elements in uploaded file names
    $filename = basename($file['name']);
    $filename = generateUniqueFilename($filename); // Assign a unique name to the uploaded file

    // Move the file to the upload directory
    $filePath = $uploadDir . $filename;
    if (!move_uploaded_file($file['tmp_name'], $filePath)) {
        die("Failed to move uploaded file.");
    }

    // Save the filepath in the MySQL database
    $stmt = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO pdf_files (filepath) VALUES (:filepath)");
    $stmt->bindParam(':filepath', $filePath);
    $stmt->execute();

    // Return the ID of the inserted record to reference the file later
    return $db->lastInsertId();
}

// Function to download the PDF file
function download_pdf($fileId) {
    global $db;

    // Retrieve the filepath from the database
    $stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT filepath FROM pdf_files WHERE id = :id");
    $stmt->bindParam(':id', $fileId, PDO::PARAM_INT);
    $stmt->execute();
    $file = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

    if ($file) {
        // Ensure the file exists
        if (file_exists($file['filepath'])) {
            // Set headers to download the file
            header('Content-Type: application/pdf');
            header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . basename($file['filepath']) . '"');
            readfile($file['filepath']);
            exit;
        } else {
            die("File not found.");
        }
    } else {
        die("Invalid file ID.");
    }
}

// Example usage:
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_FILES['pdf_file'])) {
    $fileId = upload_pdf($_FILES['pdf_file']);
    // Now you can use $fileId to reference the uploaded file for download
}
?>
```

This code snippet includes the following security measures:

1. Files are stored outside the web document root (`/var/www/uploads/`).
2. Files are checked to ensure they are PDFs before being processed.
3. Path elements are removed from the uploaded file names to prevent directory traversal attacks.
4. Unique names are assigned to uploaded files to prevent name collisions and guessing of file names.
5. The code does not execute the uploaded files, so guidelines #2 and #5 are not applicable in this context. However, if execution of files was necessary, it would be done with the lowest necessary privileges and in an isolated account with limited privileges.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and assumes that you have a table named `pdf_files` with at least two columns: `id` (auto-increment primary key) and `filepath` (varchar to store the file path). You should also ensure that your PHP environment is properly configured, and error handling is robust in your production code.
