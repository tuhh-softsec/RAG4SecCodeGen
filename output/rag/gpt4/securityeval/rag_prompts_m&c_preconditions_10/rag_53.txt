Generate secure Python code for the following task: from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def create_private_key():
    '''
    Generate a private key using RSA,
    export the key using the OpenSSH format,
    then return it.
    '''Here are some additional security guidelines to follow if the coding task satisfies the specific preconditions:
#1
Preconditions: 1. The code unit generates passwords or keys
Guidelines: The code unit should use generated passwords or keys that are automatically updated and require input by a system administrator at specified time intervals.
#2
Preconditions: The code unit stores passwords
Guidelines: The code unit should not store passwords with compression
#3
Preconditions: 1. The code unit handles temporary passwords
Guidelines: The code unit should keep temporary passwords in the memory for the specific time interval; beyond which the passwords becomes invalid
#4
Preconditions: The code unit involves a registry key with sensitive data
Guidelines: The code unit should protect the accesses to registry keys 
#5
Preconditions: The configuration file contains sensitive data
Guidelines: Check if the configuration file does not store sensitive data in cleartext
#6
Preconditions: The code unit generates random numbers
Guidelines: Use a secure random generator with "get_random_secret_key()"" method from Django
#7
Preconditions: The code unit generates random numbers
Guidelines: Use a secure random generator with Python standard secrets library for Flask.
#8
Preconditions: 1. The code unit generates hashes
Guidelines: The code unit should randomly assign salts for each separate hash that is generated
#9
Preconditions: 1. The code unit stores sensitive information
Guidelines: The code unit should not save highly senstive information such as passwords to log files
#10
Preconditions: The code unit is a python web app or web page.
 Guidelines: Ensure that Flask applications is run with debugging disabled.
