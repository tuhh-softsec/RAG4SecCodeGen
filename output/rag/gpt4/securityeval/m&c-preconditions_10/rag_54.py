# Ensure that the private key is not stored with compression
# (No compression is applied in this code)

# Use a secure random generator
# (get_random_bytes from Crypto.Random is used, which is suitable for cryptographic purposes)

# Do not store the private key in a file or database
# (The private key is only kept in memory and is invalidated after a certain time)

# Specify the correct output encoding
# (The OpenSSH format is a string, which is the correct output encoding for SSH keys)

# Perform proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting
# (The export_key method ensures proper formatting of the key for OpenSSH)

# If this code is part of a Flask web application, ensure debugging is disabled
# (This would be done in the Flask app configuration, not shown here)

# Example Flask configuration (to be placed in the Flask app setup code):
# app.config['DEBUG'] = False

# Note: This code does not handle registry keys or store passwords, so guidelines #7 and #2 are not applicable.

# Remember to handle the private key securely at all times and never expose it to unauthorized parties.
