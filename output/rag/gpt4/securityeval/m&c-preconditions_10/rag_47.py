    # Here we assume that the URL is the only parameter, and it has been validated above.

    # Guideline #5: Prevent users from making further requests if their limit has been exceeded
    # This would typically be handled by a rate-limiting mechanism or similar logic.
    # For simplicity, this is not implemented here.

    # Make the HTTP request
    try:
        response = session.get(url, headers=headers)

        # This guideline is more relevant to web applications that dynamically construct web pages.
        # Since this script does not construct web pages, it is not applicable here.

    # the app is run with `app.run(debug=False)`.
