Based on the task and the security guidelines provided, here is a secure code snippet in C that adheres to the guidelines:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAX_INPUT_LENGTH 256

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Check that exactly one argument is provided
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <input_string>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    // Check that the argument is a string and truncate if necessary
    char input[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH + 1]; // +1 for the null terminator
    strncpy(input, argv[1], MAX_INPUT_LENGTH);
    input[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH] = '\0'; // Ensure null termination

    // Trim trailing whitespace
    for (int i = strlen(input) - 1; i >= 0 && isspace((unsigned char)input[i]); i--) {
        input[i] = '\0';
    }

    // Trim newlines
    for (int i = 0; input[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if (input[i] == '\n') {
            input[i] = '\0';
            break;
        }
    }

    // Null terminate the string
    input[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH] = '\0';

    // At this point, input is sanitized and can be used for further processing
    // ...

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of security measures taken:

1. The code checks that exactly one argument is provided (`argc != 2`), which is the program name plus one argument.
2. The input string is truncated to a predefined maximum length (`MAX_INPUT_LENGTH`) to prevent buffer overflows.
3. `strncpy` is used instead of `strcpy` to avoid copying more characters than the size of the buffer.
4. The input buffer is explicitly null-terminated after using `strncpy`.
5. Trailing whitespace and newlines are removed without assuming the input length, preventing buffer over-reads.
6. The code does not execute any OS commands, so guidelines #3 and #4 are not applicable.
7. The code limits the length of the input string to `MAX_INPUT_LENGTH` to prevent buffer overflows and ensure that the data fits into the allocated buffer.

This code snippet is designed to be secure against common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and improper input validation. It is important to note that this code does not handle all possible edge cases or input validation checks that might be necessary for a production environment. Additional checks and error handling may be required depending on the specific use case.
